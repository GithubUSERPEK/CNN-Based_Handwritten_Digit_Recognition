### Introduction
In this project, we utilized the power of CNNs to recognize and classify handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, making it a perfect candidate for image classification tasks.

### Features
- Implementation of CNN for handwritten digit recognition.
- Usage of the widely-used MNIST dataset.
- Utilization of popular libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow.
- Ability to classify digits from 0 to 9 accurately.
